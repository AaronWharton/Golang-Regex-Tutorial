## Introduction ##

This small tutorial tries to teach you the basics of using regular expressions with Go. It is neither an introduction into Go, nor an introduction into regular expressions. The intended audience consists of developers that already have a concept of both and want to see how these go together in practice. It sports a cookbook approach. Every example is supposed to be complete, ready for copy-and-paste.

The text was written in Markdown. 

In the first draft I am going to cover only the functions from the regexp-package that deal with strings, because I feel that this is the most common use.
