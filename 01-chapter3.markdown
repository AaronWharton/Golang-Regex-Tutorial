## grep ##

The grep-tool searches for (regular) expressions in text files. Every single line is read and if the line matches the pattern provided on the command line, that line is printed.



## Search and Replace ##

This tool is a grep on steroids. It does not only search for a pattern, but can also replace the pattern with something else. We will obviously want to build on the existing grep solution.

## Find a number ##

Numbers are not as simple as you might at first think.
